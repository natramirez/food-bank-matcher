# Executive Summary

Reporting environmental issues is hard to do, and finding out about them is even harder! The EPA manages big issues, but small neighborhood concerns often slip under their radar. City- and county-level websites are often poorly designed and hard to navigate, and it can be difficult for private citizens to be sure their concerns are being addressed.

Spill aims to change that. Spill is a website where users share information about environmental issues. Users can report a new issue, check up on old ones, or find issues specific to an area, whether close to them or far away. Whether youâ€™re a corporate whistleblower, concerned parent, or local official, Spill is the place for your environmental concern. 

Spill is made by a team of six students from San Francisco State University studying computer science, as part of Computer Science 648: Software Engineering under Dragutin Petkovic and Anthony Souza. For more information, check out http://sfsuteam06spilldemo.dnsd.info/.
